My name is Kirk Hietpas! 
I am a Software Engineer located in Salt Lake City, UT. 

I currently work for PassiveLogic as a Cloud Engineer in a Full Stack capacity. In my day to day I work with Javascript and Swift.

In the mean time, please feel free to look around my GitHub profile, specifically within the ForEmployers repo.
