Hello!

My name is Kirk Hietpas! 
I am currently a Master of Software Development student at the University of Utah. I am currently in search of Software Engineering positions and/or Sofware Engineering internships.


I would love to discuss my qualifications in greater detail! I can be reached via email (hietpaskirk@gmail.com) or phone (715-577-2551). 
In the mean time, please feel free to look around my GitHub profile, specifically within the ForEmployers repo. Thanks!
